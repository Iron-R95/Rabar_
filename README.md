### 0. Intro

Postman is more than just an API-client that Postman is known for. Postman is a platform with a set of very useful tools that will make creating and managing APIs easier, and besides, Postman can save developers a lot of time and effort.

### 1. Installation

Developers can use Postman in different ways, Postman can be used both as a web-app and as a direct install program, in addition, Postman is available for different operating systems such as Linux, Windows, etc.

And developers can also use Postman without having to register, but registration is recommended as it has some advantages, e.g. data backup, because Postman is cloud-based or registration is mandatory if developers want to set up a public workspace or network. I've already registered so that I can show all the important parts of Postman in the course of this tutorial.

The following screenshot shows what Postman looks like after installation, the developer can register or log in directly or at the bottom left there is also the possibility to use Postman directly without an account.

### 2. API-Repository

Developers can store, catalog and collaborate on one central platform. Postman provides us with a cloud-based and centralized repository throughout the API-Lifecycle, so we will have no any kind of problem by storing and managing of API specifications, tests, workflow, documentation, etc. And it doesn't matter if we have only one API or multiple APIs, we can very well organize and simplify everything around API world with Postman-API-Repository.

 ##### 2.1.1. Private API-Network
 
Teams and organizations can set up a private API network with Postman, which is only visible to authorized people and supports creating API versions.

 According to Postman, Postman's Public-API-Network is the world's largest public API-Hub, which many well-known companies like Microsoft, Google, etc.    are on. With the help of Public-API-Network we can release Worksapces, APIs, and other things worldwide
